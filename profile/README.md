## Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium

This is the home of the [Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium](https://www.typhoidgenomics.org/) on github

### Consortium goals
* Encourage prompt sharing of typhoid genome data for public health benefit
* Facilitate the extraction and reporting of key data of public health relevance
* Promote and facilitate the dissemination and use of information derived from typhoid genomic data to monitor antimicrobial resistance and post-vaccination impact

The Consortium is open to anyone to join, see [here](https://www.typhoidgenomics.org/#h.ndso9a2oxt8u) for more info.
